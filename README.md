# Standup

Have you ever been in a standup, and suddenly thought—

> What the FUCK did I do today?

I know I have. Hell, I think that every waking moment of my life.

Well, if you use Codebase to manage your projects, boy are you in luck today.

## Usage

To find out what the FUCK you did today, open up a terminal and type—

    python -m codebase <username> <key> <project>

(NB, you can find <username> and <key> in Codebase somewhere.) Wait a few seconds and BOOM instant standup information.
Added bonus is you can see what everyone else did, and call them out on LYING.

Still a bit rusty and WIP but it works. Oh yeah you'll probably need to `pip install requests` first.
